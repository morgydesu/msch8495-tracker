# msch8495-tracker
# Music tracker according to BPM 

Previous objective:
"To keep track of the user's BPM (beats per minute) choice in music that is associated with their mood. Furthermore, analyze the collected data into a graph for the user to see as a visual element of their BPM usage throughout the week, month, and/or year."

Objective:
"To keep track of the user's BPM by saving the user input of their song name and its BPM in the music tracker. This will then be saved onto the local storage and entry list (the visible history list)."

## Required functionality <msch8495-tracker>
Data Model:
* The user input from the entry list contains the date, image of the chosen BPM category (heart with arrows), name of the song, ID of the entry, and BPM as a category. In addition, the ID is automatically updated. If an entry is deleted from the entry list and local storage, the entry which was placed after it would automatically be updated to an ID number of the deleted entry (#3 becomes #2).

Add/delete: 
* The user input can be added and deleted from the local storage and entry list. The local storage is coded in the musictracker.js with button functionality that allows adding and deleting. The entry list shows the added list from the user input. Similar to the local storage, if an entry is deleted from the entry list then it would be deleted as well. 


Associated data:
* The toggle function hides the information about the songs in the Discover section. It shows the year, name of the song, and BPM when the user clicks the toggle. 

Minimal web server:
* There are minimal external sources that are encoded in this. Instead, it uses local storage and already downloaded images and font. It has a simple backend code that mainly focuses on the music tracker function.

A single page architecture:
* It uses a single HTML file for the tracker application. But it consists of two javascript files which are musictracker.js and discover.js. There are four scss (including the main.scss) files that are imported to the main scss.
 
Responsive page:
* The tracker is coded in the scss so that it follows the mobile and desktop size. For the mobile size, I used a max-width: 640px. And for the web view, I used min-width: 1009px.

Save the data to the user's browser + Be easy to setup, configure and run on a local computer:
* It uses an integration of local storage and a visual element of the entry list for the user input.

Use GitHub for version control and code repository hosting:
* Everything used in this tracker application is updated on GitHub, under the name "msch8495-tracker".


## Changes from the Web App Design <msch8495-tracker>
* Data Analysis - I was not able to input a data that is associated with the user's BPM and create an analyzed report of recommended song selection. If with more time and practice, it may be possible.

* Sidebar function - In the design, I wanted to use a sidebar which would contain the music tracker but instead I got a feedback from the tutor. The feedback was to use a simple filter function that is displayed in the middle-top of the screen. For the design in the prototye, the music tracker is placed on the right side of the screen. It promotes an easy access for the users. 

* Single page architecture for the frontend - In the design assignment, I seemed to have two extra HTML rather than just one. This was because I wanted to use a more complex data to create a unique tracker with the BPM involved. But from my tutor's feedback, he told me to break down the throught process into simple steps Because of this I thought of breaking down the main elements that are required for the web prototype into focusing on two things: BPM as category and manual user input. 

* Data Model - I improved the data model by addressing the requirements better and implementing a more user input focused model. Instead of having automatic inputs, it would ask the user to input the data. In addition, this allowed a more accessible coding technique for my level. 

* Play button - In the design assignment, the play button system with skip, loop, etc were used. However, in the actual prototype it was hard to code it. In addition when breaking down the necessary design functions of this tracker application, this play button was unnecessary and took away from the main concept of it. 


## Using the tracker <msch8495-tracker>

To use <msch8495-tracker>, follow these steps:
```
1.Scroll through the discover section of the application. 
2. Find more information about the song by clicking the toggle under the songs.
3. Input the information into the music tracker.
4. Once you put in all of your entries, the list with all the entries wil be visible below the music tracker.
5. If you want to delete the entry from your playlist, click the delte button next to the entry in the playlist. 
```
