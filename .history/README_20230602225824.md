# msch8495-tracker
# Music tracker according to BPM 

Previous objective:
"To keep track of the user's BPM (beats per minute) choice in music that is associated with their mood. Furthermore, analyze the collected data into a graph for the user to see as a visual element of their BPM usage throughout the week, month, and/or year."

Objective:
"To keep track of the user's BPM by saving the user input of their song name and its BPM in the music tracker. This will then be saved onto the local storage and entry list (the visible history list)."

## Requirement <msch8495-tracker>
Data Model:
* The user input from the entry list contains the date, image of the chosen BPM category (heart with arrows), name of the song, ID of the entry, BPM as category. In addition, the ID is automatically updated. Basically if an entry is deleted from the entry list and local storage, the entry which was placed after it would automatically be updated to an ID number of the deleted entry (#3 becomes #2).

Add/delete: 
* The user input can be added and delted from the local storage and entry list. The local storage is coded in the musictracker.js with button functionality that allows adding and deleting. The entry list shows the added list from the user input. Similar to the local storage, if a entry is deleted from the entry list then it would be delted as well. 

Associated data:
* The toggle function hides the information of the songs in the discover section. It shows the year, name of the song, and BPM when the user clicks the toggle. 

Minimal web server:
* There are minimal external source that are encoded in this. Instead, it uses the local storage and a already downloaded images and font. It has a simple backend code which mainly focuses on the music tracker function. 

A single page architecture:
* It uses a single HTML file for the tracker application. But it consists of two javascrip file which are musictracker.js adn discover.js. There are four scss (including the main.scss) file which are imported to the main scss.
 
Responsive page:
* The tracker is coded in the scss so that it follows the mobile and desktop size. For the mobile size, I used max-width: 640px. And for the web-view, I used min-width: 1009px.

Save the data to the user's browser + Be easy to setup, configure and run on a local computer:
* It uses integoration of local storage and visual element of entry list for the user input.

Use GitHub for version control and code repository hosting:
* Everything used in this tracker application is updated into the GitHub, under the name "msch8495-tracker".
