## Requirement
-Data Model:
    The user input from the entry list contains the date, image of the chosen BPM category (heart with arrows), name of the song, ID of the entry, BPM as category. In addition, the ID is automatically updated. Basically if an entry is deleted from the entry list and local storage, the entry which was placed after it would automatically be updated to an ID number of the deleted entry (#3 becomes #2).
-Add/delete: 
    The user input can be added and delted from the local storage and entry list. The local storage is coded in the musictracker.js with button functionality that allows adding and deleting. The entry list shows the added list from the user input. Similar to the local storage, if a entry is deleted from the entry list then it would be delted as well. 
-Associated data:
    The toggle function hides the information of the songs in the discover section. It shows the year, name of the song, and BPM when the user clicks the toggle. 
-minimal web server:
    There are minimal external source that are encoded in this. Instead, it uses the local storage and a already downloaded images and fonts.
